# Smart Startup Evaluator Crew
This project uses a multi-agent AI crew to evaluate startup ideas. Here’s how it works:

1. *Market Research*: The AI analyzes the market size, trends, and customer segments for your idea.
2. *Competitor Analysis*: The AI identifies competitors, performs SWOT analysis, and suggests differentiators.
3. *Financial Forecasting*: The AI estimates costs, revenue models, and provides 1–3 year projections.
4. *Pitch Deck Generation*: The AI consolidates all findings into a professional pitch deck and a one-page summary.

You provide a startup idea (or let the system generate one). The process is fully automated and results are saved to output.txt.
